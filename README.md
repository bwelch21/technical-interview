## Data Structures/Concepts and Corresponding Algorithms
  *Taken primarily from http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/*<br>
  *Number Theory and Bit Manipulation topics not included since I've never come across these in a technical interview*
  1. **Graphs**
      * Breadth First Search
      * Depth First Search
      * Shortest Path from source to all vertices (Dijkstra's)
      * Shortest Path from every vertex to every other vertex (Floyd's)
      * Detect a cycle in a Graph
      * Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's as well as Kruskal's)
      * Topological Sort
      * Find all possible words in a board of characters
      * Bridges in a Graph
  2. **Linked Lists**
      * Insertion of a node given certain constraints
      * Deletion of a node given some constraints
      * Compare two strings represented as Linked Lists
      * Add two numbers represented by Linked Lists
      * Merge a Linked List into another Linked List at alternate positions
      * Reverse a Linked List in groups of a given size
      * Union and intersection of two Linked Lists
      * Detect and remove a loop in a Linked List
      * Merge sort for Linked Lists
      * Select a random node from a singly-Linked List
  3. **Dynamic Programming**
      * Longest Common Subsequence
      * Longest Increasing Subsequence
      * Edit distance
      * Minimum partition

  4. **Sorting and Searching**
      * Binary search
      * Search an element in a sorted and rotated array
      * Bubble sort
      * Insertion sort
      * Merge sort
      * Heap sort (binary heap)
      * Quick sort
      * Interpolation sort
      * Find k-th smallest/largest element in an unsorted array
      * Given a sorted array and a number x, find the pair whose sum is closest to x (2 sum variant)
  5. Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree
      * Find minimum depth of Binary Tree
      * Maximum path sum in a Binary Tree
      * Check if a given array represents the preorder traversal of a Binary Tree
      * Check whether Binary Tree is full or not

      * Print nodes in top view of a Binary Tree
      * Remove nodes on root to leaf paths of length < k
      * Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree
      * Check if a tree is a subset of another
      * Reverse alternate levels of a perfect Binary Tree
  6. String/Array
      * Reverse an array without affecting special characrters
      * All possible palindromic partitions
      * Count triplets with sum smaller than a given value
      * Convert array into zig-zag fashion
      * Generate all possible sorted arrays from alternate methods of two given sorted arrays
      * Pythagorean triple in an array
      * Length of the largest subarray with contiguous elements
